      <input class="spacing" type="radio" name="q3" value="q3a">A: No. Don't take care of yourself. It's better to neglect yourself and pour all of your energy into caring for your partner. Even if you're on the verge of passing out from pouring out all of your love, suck it up and keep neglecting yourself.</input><br><br>
	  	<input class="spacing" type="radio" name="q3" value="q3b">B: Yes. Taking care of yourself is healthy. That way, you can come back to the relationship energized and ready to give positivity and love to your partner. In addition, by taking care of yourself, you don't develop stress or resentment. "Me-time" is highly encouraged!</input><br><br>

      <input class="spacing"  type="radio" name="q5" value="q5a">A: It depends. Sometimes, you end up with someone you're really compatible and similar to, so you end up agreeing on a lot of things. However, know that sometimes, disagreements will come up and that's okay. It's perfectly fine to disagree on some things.</input><br><br>
		  <input class="spacing" type="radio" name="q5" value="q5b">B: Yes. You should agree with your partner on everything. Even if in the back of your mind you actually don't agree on something, it's better to lie and say that you do. That way, you can keep his or her love. Having differences can kill a relationship, you know?</input><br><br>
