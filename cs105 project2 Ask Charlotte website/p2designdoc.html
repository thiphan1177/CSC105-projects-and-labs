<p><center>Thao Phan’s Design Document</center><p>

<p>Mission statement -  I am making a website for an imaginary advice columnist. It helps visitors of the site submit their advice questions to her and also gives them information about other advice, a quiz, books, and info about her, etc.</p>

<p><center>Required elements</center></p>

<p>Forms – My quiz page is one of the forms. The user fills it out and when he/she clicks submit, the answers get processed via Javascript which tells the user what questions they answered correctly. I also used a form in the ‘Write to Me’ page. It’s where the user can send a message that asks “Charlotte,” the imaginary advice columnist, for advice. Their form results take them to a new page where they can review what they submitted.</p>

<p>Cookies - I used cookies in the Advice with Cookies Quiz. There, I modified the cookies lab that you had us do with different question and choices.</p>

<p>User feedback – In the navigation bar, I’ve made it so that when you mouse-over it, then whichever part of the nav bar your mouse is over turns to white with a red inset. In addition, I also added a drop down menu that opens up on the ‘Others’ and ‘Quiz’ part of the bar. Another user feedback element I’ve added is down at the bottom of each page, I’ve added images of the Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram logo. When the user hovers over a particular logo, it enlarges, and when the user moves their mouse away from the social media logo, it returns back to its original size. Another user feedback element I’ve added are in the Articles and Books pages. When a user hovers over a link in either of the pages, the link shows them a preview of the page that's to come if they click on it.</p>

</p>Canvas Graphics – I used canvas graphics in the Books page where I drew the books. Note that there's kind of a glitch. If you click on the Books page in the nav-bar, the books will each have a nice font that's individual to each book. If they don't, then you should click Books page in the nav-bar again. Don't refresh it. That doesn't work.</p>

<p>Interactive Javascript Elements - I used interactive javascript elements in a page titled "interactive javascript form." I used one of the examples you had as a foundation and adjusted it. It asks the user for their name, if they want advice, and what color they like out of the 3 choices given. I think that the Cookies page might also count as another element, but I am not sure.</p>

<p>Project 1 Elements – This cite incorporated elements from project 1 in that it uses a single style sheet (there are some internal styles though), has images, classes, ids and the rest of the elements that I used in my html documents, a navigation aid, and has a nice design.</p>

<p>Thought process - For the layout and structure of the website, I wanted it to be simple. Thus, there’s only one column with all the information on it, aside from the logo and navigation bar. I was thinking of having two (or three columns) like I did in project 1. However, I decided against it because it’s an advice columnist’s website. Although I like the two/three column layout, I didn’t want it cluttered with unnecessary information. I wanted the user to visit my site and think “I am on the website. Here is where I click if I want to ask “Charlotte” for advice. There is where I click if I want to read articles. Over there is where I click if I want to see her books.”</p>

<p>Because of the simplistic structure, I wanted to spice up the look so I did several things. First, I chose a variety of shades for the site’s color palette: pine green, emerald green, mahogany, magenta and gold. These shades gave the site visual appeal and made it look vibrant. Secondly, I placed box shadows in the website to make it more 3-dimensional. Thirdly, I chose several different fonts to jazz it up too. Fourthly, I rounded the corners of the column, logo, and nav bar containers which sleekened and modernized the look.</p>

<p>Use of images - Since this is an advice columnist's website, the main content are forms and words. There aren't many images. I only placed them where I thought it would enhance the mission of the site which is in the Home page. The female in the picture is my cousin and she gave me permission to use them for this project. I think that the books in the Books page kind of count as images too even though they were drawn on canvas. </p>

<p>Things I'm proud of - One thing I’m proud of is how the website looks overall. It's an improvement from project 1. Two other things I'm proud of are the cookies and quiz pages. I'm proud that I got them to work.</p>

<p>Regarding the javascript code I used, they were codes that other people wrote and that I modified. With several of the codes, I had to modify them a lot to get the effects that I wanted. In the Articles and Books pages of my site, where the user can preview a link, I achieved the effect with javascript code I found on StackOverFlow as a guide. When I was drawing the books, I used code from w3schools that helped me achieve a gradient effect for the book covers. When creating the dropdown menu, I altered code from CodePen.com. In the Home page, where you see the transitioning pictures of “Charlotte the advice columnist,” I didn’t know how to create a transitioning gallery so I modified code from w3school help me create it. When making the quiz and having it be processed through javascript, I found a nice example of a quiz from one of the students in the CS105 Hall of Fame. She created a John Mayer fanpage. I changed that as well. Also, when creating the interactive javascript form, I used your code from the CS105 examples page as a guide.</p>

<p>Browsers - I only tested my website on Safari and Mozilla Firefox. They work with a minor difference. Mozilla seems to dull colors and that's what happened when I displayed my site on the browser. I tried other colors that were more vibrant shades with Mozilla but they did not seem to improve the dullness. Safari doesn't have this problem. I don't have other browsers besides these two so I did not test how my website looked like on them. </p>

<p>Bugs - With the links that give previews on the Articles and Books pages, some of the links take a while to load. Others are for some reason quicker about this.</p>
